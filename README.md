## Purpose
When I practised speaking for Toefl, I had to use external software and do several steps manually (timing, recording, and saving) before writing this program.
Consequently, I decided to create a program that can allow me to complete the process by click a button.  
This program contains simple functions and resembles the iBT's user interface.  
After I passed the test, I wanted to share this program and finally I have time to upload it to GitHub.  
Wish you will enjoy it and achieve a high score.

## Features
1. Precise timing.
2. Automatic recording and saving.
3. Short directions and "Beep" sound included.
4. Abort midway if you want.

## Dependency
- Qt 5
- MSVC 2015 (other versions are likely to work as well, but I do not garantee.)

## Development Environment
This project is developed in Qt Creator 4, with compilers of MSVC 2015.

## Bug report
Please open issues to report bugs.  
Pull requests are also welcomed.
